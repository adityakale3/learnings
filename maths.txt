1. e            In JavaScript, we shorten a number by appending the letter "e" to the number and specifying the zeroes count:
                let billion = 1e9;
                let ms = 1e-6;  // 0.000001;

2. Math.floor   Rounds down: 3.1 becomes 3, and -1.1 becomes -2.
   Math.ceil    Rounds up: 3.1 becomes 4, and -1.1 becomes -1.
   Math.round   Rounds to the nearest integer: 3.1 becomes 3, 3.6 becomes 4 and -1.1 becomes -1.

3. toFixed(n)   let num = 12.34;    alert( num.toFixed(1) ); // "12.3"
